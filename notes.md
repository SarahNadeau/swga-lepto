* [ ] check that primers cover as many of the 545 genes suggested for cgMLST by [Guglielmini et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007374) as possible
* [ ] and the 7 genes used for traditional MLST (see [Caimi et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134817302708?via%3Dihub))
* [ ] compare sum of amplicon size from SWGA to sum of amplicon size from traditional (~7 gene) MLST schemes

Questions

* Why would [Guglielmini et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007374) remove loci from previously defined Leptospira MLST schemes? Seems like these would still be informative.
