Used swga-lepto script run_swga_lepto_human_like_nau.sh at commit 72bd58 and wf-swga at commit e77d800 to generate primers.

Low temp runs don't find any sets, possibly because not enough primers to search amongst. See like_nau_try_3 for follow-up analysis.

Used script score_sets_on_secondary_targets.sh to get primer binding sites on other lepto species genomes. A few runs seemingly failed (empty set score output files) but upon re-running the script the output was normal.

Double-checked primer melting temperatures for selected primer set using IDT's OligoAnalyzer tool online with settings used by Mark Itsko from DBD:
[Oligos] = 4 uM
[dNTPs] = 4 mM
[Na+] = 50 mM
[Mg2+] = 10 mM
